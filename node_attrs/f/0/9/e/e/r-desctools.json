The reason for\n    collecting them here, was primarily to have them consolidated in ONE instead of dozens of packages (which themselves might depend on other packages which are not needed at all), and to provide a common and consistent interface as far as function and arguments naming, NA handling, recycling rules etc. are concerned. Google\n    style guides were used as naming rules (in absence of convincing alternatives). The 'camel style' was consequently applied to functions borrowed from contributed R packages as well.\n  license_family: GPL2\n  license_file:\n    - {{ environ[\"PREFIX\"] }}/lib/R/share/licenses/GPL-2\n    - {{ environ[\"PREFIX\"] }}/lib/R/share/licenses/GPL-3\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - conda-forge/r\n",
