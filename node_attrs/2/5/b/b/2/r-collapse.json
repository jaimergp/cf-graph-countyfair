It is well integrated with base R, 'dplyr' / (grouped) 'tibble', 'data.table', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), 'sf' data frames, and non-destructively handles other matrix or data frame based classes (such as 'ts', 'xts' / 'zoo', 'timeSeries', 'tsibble', 'tibbletime' etc.) --- Key Features: --- (1) Advanced statistical programming: A full set of fast statistical functions supporting grouped and weighted computations on vectors, matrices and data frames. Fast and programmable grouping, ordering, unique values / rows, factor generation and interactions. Fast and flexible functions for data manipulation, data object conversions, and memory efficient R programming. (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function, weighted, parallelized and fully custom data aggregation. (3) Advanced transformations: Fast row / column arithmetic, (grouped) replacing and sweeping out of statistics, (grouped, weighted) scaling / standardizing, between (averaging) and (quasi-)within (demeaning) transformations, higher-dimensional centering (i.e. multiple fixed effects or polynomials), linear prediction, model fitting and testing exclusion restrictions. (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast (sequences of) lags / leads, and (lagged / leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-) differences and (compounded) growth rates on (irregular) time series and panel data. Multivariate auto-, partial- and cross-correlation functions for panel data. Panel data to (ts-)array conversions. (5) List processing: (Recursive) list search, splitting, extraction / subsetting, data-apply, and generalized recursive row-binding / unlisting in 2D. (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) summary statistics for complex multilevel / panel data.\n# URL: https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/, https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse, https://twitter.com/collapse_R\n# BugReports: https://github.com/SebKrantz/collapse/issues\n# License: GPL (>= 2) | file LICENSE\n# Encoding: UTF-8\n# LazyData: true\n# Depends: R (>= 2.10)\n# Imports: Rcpp (>= 1.0.1)\n# LinkingTo: Rcpp\n# Suggests: fastverse, data.table, magrittr, kit, sf, plm, fixest, vars, RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen, dplyr, ggplot2, scales, microbenchmark, testthat, covr, knitr, rmarkdown\n# SystemRequirements: C++11\n# VignetteBuilder: knitr\n# NeedsCompilation: yes\n# Packaged: 2022-02-11 00:37:13 UTC; Sebastian Krantz\n# Author: Sebastian Krantz [aut, cre], Matt Dowle [ctb], Arun Srinivasan [ctb], Morgan Jacob [ctb], Dirk Eddelbuettel [ctb], Laurent Berge [ctb], Kevin Tappe [ctb], R Core Team and contributors worldwide [ctb], Martyn Plummer [cph], 1999-2016 The R Core Team [cph]\n# Maintainer: Sebastian Krantz <sebastian.krantz@graduateinstitute.ch>\n# Repository: CRAN\n# Date/Publication: 2022-02-11 12:30:02 UTC\n",
